This is a file with thoughts on what should be implemented and for what version.
This list is likely to change, no guarantees what so ever.

1.0
Option to quit modazipin when launching game.
Allow new addins to be created, empty or with unknown files.

Future
Keep track of files added or removed from the folders while running.
Recreate dazip from addin (requires a zip writing lib).
Icons (requires code to read dds data)
